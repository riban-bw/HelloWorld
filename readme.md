This project is purely to provide a test bed for me to hone my github skills.

Git is proving to be more challenging to use than the previous version control systems I have used, namely cvs and subversion. I found subversion to be an excellent tool that was easy to learn and teach the basics.

I used subversion for several years for a range of projects. It gave me confidence to code freely, knowing that I could revert changes quickly and easily. I was able to educate colleagues in the basics of its use allowing collaboration on large projects with minimal support.

Whilst away from base, I found subversion to be limited, not allowing commits and hence removing the freedom to code with version control. Git offered this feature (as did a couple of other version control systems).

Since using git I have found it non-intuitve.
